> **See the Vibe. Hear the Mood.**

SonoLens is a multimodal, AI-enhanced music exploration tool that converts visual inspiration into personalized Spotify playlists. By analyzing the mood, color palette, and atmosphere of an uploaded image using GPT-4o Vision, SonoLens curates a sonic experience that matches what you see.

Built with a bold **Neo-Brutalist** aesthetic, it is designed to be a functional and visually distinct creative assistant.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Intention:**
Music and imagery are deeply connected. SonoLens aims to bridge the gap between visual and auditory senses (synesthesia), allowing users to generate soundtracks for their photos, art, or environments instantly. Whether you're capturing a rainy street, a vibrant party, or a quiet sunset, SonoLens finds the music that fits.

### Key Features
- **🔐 Secure Authentication:** Full Spotify OAuth 2.0 implementation using the PKCE flow (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for maximum security.
- **📸 Image Analysis:** Uses OpenAI's **GPT-4o Vision** to extract mood, energy, color theory, and descriptive keywords from any image.
- **🤖 AI-Powered Curation:** Translates visual data into specific Spotify audio features (valence, energy, danceability) and seed genres.
- **🎧 Interactive Playlist Generation:**
  - Generates ~20 track recommendations based on the analysis.
  - **Mini Player:** Preview tracks directly in the browser (30s clips or full playback for Premium).
  - **Editor:** Remove unwanted tracks or drag-and-drop to reorder the flow.
- **💾 Save to Spotify:** One-click export to save the curated playlist directly to your Spotify library.
- **📱 Responsive Design:** Fully functional on desktop and mobile (including camera capture support).
